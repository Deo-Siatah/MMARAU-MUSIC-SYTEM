Christian Union Music Ministry Digital System
Final Design Decisions (Pre-Implementation)

============================================
1. OVERALL SYSTEM STRUCTURE
============================================

The system will consist of TWO MAIN DASHBOARDS:

1. Main Dashboard (Operational)
2. Analytics Dashboard (Insights & Decision Support)

Navigation between dashboards will be handled using a SIMPLE HAMBURGER MENU,
designed primarily for mobile use, with minimal menu items.

Menu Items:
- Main Dashboard
- Analytics Dashboard
(Optional future: Members – admin only)

The goal is to keep daily usage simple for non-technical users while allowing
leaders to access insights separately.

--------------------------------------------

============================================
2. MAIN DASHBOARD (PRIMARY USER AREA)
============================================

Purpose:
- Used weekly by the secretary
- Optimized for speed, clarity, and simplicity
- No charts or heavy analytics

Main Dashboard Components:

1. Top Information Section
- Current date (auto-generated)
- Semester progress:
  - Current week number
  - Number of weeks remaining

2. Primary Action
- A single prominent button:
  “Record Service”

This is the main interaction point and should visually stand out.

3. Recent Ministry Records
- Cards displaying services from the PAST TWO WEEKS only
- Maximum of 4 cards (Saturday & Sunday)
- Each card shows:
  - Date
  - Service type (Saturday / Sunday)
  - Lead ministers
  - Backup ministers

Purpose:
- Quick confirmation that records were saved correctly
- Easy reference without entering analytics
- Reduces confusion and repeated questions

--------------------------------------------

============================================
3. RECORD SERVICE WORKFLOW
============================================

This workflow must remain calm, linear, and forgiving.

STEP 1: Select Service Details
- Date picker (defaults to today)
- Service type: Saturday or Sunday

STEP 2: Select Voice Group
- Voice groups shown as tabs or buttons:
  - Alto
  - Tenor
  - Soprano
- Only ONE voice group visible at a time

STEP 3: Select Ministers
- Ministers displayed as a checklist
- Each minister shows a SMALL color indicator:
  - Red: Has not ministered in the last 3 weeks
  - Neutral/Gray: Normal participation
  - Yellow (optional): Recently used frequently

Colors are subtle and supported by tooltips.
No user must memorize color meanings.

STEP 4: Lead / Backup Assignment
- Lead/Backup selection appears ONLY after a minister is checked
- Simple toggle per selected minister
- Default can be Backup to reduce pressure

STEP 5: Undo & Error Prevention
- Unchecking a minister reverses all selections
- Ministers selected in one voice are disabled in others
- Prevents duplicate selection silently

STEP 6: Save & Confirm
- Save action records service
- User is returned to main dashboard
- Recent service card appears immediately

--------------------------------------------

============================================
4. HANDLING MULTI-VOICE MINISTERS
============================================

- A minister may belong to multiple voice groups
- A minister may be selected ONLY ONCE per service
- If selected under one voice:
  - Disabled in other voice tabs
  - Labeled “Already selected”

This avoids confusion without extra warnings.

--------------------------------------------

============================================
5. ANALYTICS DASHBOARD
============================================

Purpose:
- Used by leaders and coordinators
- Focused on insights, fairness, and planning
- No data entry here

Analytics Dashboard Sections:

1. Overview Cards (Top)
- Total services this semester
- Number of active ministers
- Average ministers per service
- Gender ratio

2. Performance Ranking Chart
- Horizontal Bar Chart
- Sorted from highest to lowest
- Filter options:
  - All
  - Ladies
  - Gents
- Scrollable for large datasets (e.g. 50 ministers)

3. Gender Participation Chart
- Donut or Pie Chart
- Visual overview of gender balance

4. Weekly Participation Trend
- Line Chart
- X-axis: Weeks
- Y-axis: Number of ministers per service
- Used to identify trends over the semester

5. Fairness / Distribution Check (Optional)
- Histogram or bar chart
- Shows distribution of ministry frequency
- Helps prevent burnout and neglect

--------------------------------------------

============================================
6. RESPONSIVENESS & UX PRINCIPLES
============================================

- Mobile-first design
- Vertical scrolling preferred over cramped layouts
- One chart per row on mobile
- Grid layout on md+ screens
- Charts are responsive using container-based sizing

Secretary View:
- No charts
- No analytics
- Simple forms only

Leader View:
- Visual summaries
- Filters instead of raw tables

--------------------------------------------

============================================
7. CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
============================================

- Simplicity over cleverness
- Progressive disclosure (one decision at a time)
- Visual cues instead of numbers
- Automation supports people, not replaces them
- Fairness without competition
- Power underneath, calm on the surface

--------------------------------------------

============================================
8. MVP BOUNDARY (SCOPE LOCK)
============================================

IN SCOPE:
- Main Dashboard
- Record Service workflow
- Recent service cards
- Analytics dashboard with core charts

OUT OF SCOPE (FOR NOW):
- Automatic messaging
- Advanced permissions
- AI recommendations
- Overly detailed reports

These may be revisited after feedback.
